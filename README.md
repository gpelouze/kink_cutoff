3D MHD simulations of propagating kink waves in open field lines using PLUTO.

Directories description:

- `setups/`: file for several PLUTO setups, each described in their respective
  README. The interesting setups are `open_chromos_3D` (3D simulations with
  chromosphere and transition region), and `open_chromos_relax_2D` (2D
  relaxation run, which output is used to initialize the `open_chromos_3D`
  runs).
- `testing_and_fumbling/`: tests and verification scripts, mostly deprecated,
  and probably partly broken.
